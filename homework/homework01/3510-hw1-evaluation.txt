COMMENTS:

Q4c: You picked the shorter time, of course, but be aware that there may
     be some other constraints which might need consideration even when
     picking this shorter duration.

Q5: you didn't answer the two questions in your text directly, only leaving
    it to me to interpret the results from your program.

Overall, nice work on this first assignment.
