Nice work!  Too bad you had your philo-C-phers program stop after a certain
   time rather than just keep running.  It would have been better to let it
   run forever just to make sure that there is never a point when deadlock
   kicks in...  but it works, and your rationale [from question #2 which was
   supposed to be in a separate file, but whatever] makes sense.
