Evaluation #2
====================================
Project: chown command modification to prevent '.*' modifications
Type:    likely a core utility; possibly a kernel command

Evaluation
----------

A few things missing from this submission

OK, you are doing a new core utility, so there's nothing to put into section
   2.1.  However, you didn't bother to label it.

Section 2.2, you can't have "N/A" for both sections 2.1 and 2.2.  SOMETHING
   is getting modified or added.  Although the core utilities are not a
   'strict' part of the kernel, they are still part of Linux.  Thus, if you
   are going to add a new core utility, THAT is the module to specify in
   this section.  To say "N/A" on both sections would mean that you aren't
   actually going to do ANYTHING!

Section 2.3, the same logic applies here.  You are building SOMETHING, so
   you need to have some sort of diagram showing what you are building, what
   the parts of it are, and how it fits into the rest of Linux.  It doesn't
   strictly HAVE to be a 'class diagram', but you need some sort of diagram
   to show what's going on.

Section 2.4 is fine.

Because of the missing parts here, there is quite a bit of missing credit as
   well.  Basically only average work.  Perhaps you didn't understand what
   is expected for this submission, although I explained it during class.
