Evaluation
----------

Good work on this submission

Pretty good explanation in section 1.1 ~ clearly defined goal so that you
   are communicating what your project will do

Very good rationale in section 1.2 ~ great justification as long as you are
   talking about changing multiple file extensions.  Single files can be
   changed with the "mv" command already, but if you are changing extentions
   for a list of files that is OK.  Nothing wrong with duplicating existing
   functionality if there is a twist to it, and if you learn from it.

In Section 1.3 ~ there are several modules linked to the core utility that
   you are modifying/adding; do some research and see what they are.  You may
   need to read through the 'Makefile' to see what is involved as well.

Section 1.4 ~ you need to do a bit more research into what is involved with
   this modification

Decent job overall!

An "A-minus" job on this first project deliverable ~ professional-quality
   work!
