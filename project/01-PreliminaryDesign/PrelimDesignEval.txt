Evaluation
----------

Good work on this submission

Pretty good explanation in section 1.1 ~ clearly defined goal so that you
   are communicating what your project will do

Very good rationale in section 1.2 ~ great justification

In Section 1.3 ~ there are several modules linked to the chown core utility;
   do some research and see what they are.  You may need to read through the
   'Makefile' to see what is involved as well.

Section 1.4 ~ you need to do a bit more research into what is involved with
   this modification

Decent job overall!

An "A-minus" job on this first project deliverable ~ professional-quality
   work!
